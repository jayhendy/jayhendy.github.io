              While mid-air gestures are an attractive modality with an extensive research history, one challenge with their usage is that the gestures are not self-revealing. Scaffolding techniques to teach these gestures are difficult to implement since the input device, e.g. a hand, wand or arm, cannot present the gestures to the user. In contrast, for touch gestures, feedforward mechanisms (such as Marking Menus or OctoPocus) have been shown to effectively support user awareness and learning. In this paper, we explore whether touch gesture input can be leveraged to teach users to perform mid-air gestures. We show that marking menu touch gestures transfer directly to knowledge of mid-air gestures, allowing performance of these gestures without intervention. We argue that cross-modal learning can be an effective mechanism for introducing users to mid-air gestural input.
